Attempting to recreate http://csrankings.org/collab/ with JCU researcher data

Need to create a matrix of ocurrences to use the same D3 code.

## Explanation

*  `collab/` contains the graph page from `csrankings.org` to populate with JCU data.

* `data-preparation` contains the sample data we `input/` into the python munging code `matrix-making.py` to create a matrix expected by D3.js in `output`.


## Getting Started

```shell
cd collab
npm install -g serve
serve
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser and get hacking.

## TODO

- [ ] Find out what is missing.
